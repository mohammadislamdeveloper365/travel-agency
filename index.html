      <h1>Discover Bangladesh</h1>
      <p>
        Bangladeshis are renowned for their hospitality and warmth – they’ll
        invite you home and treat you to their delectable cuisine. They are
        passionate about food, football, cricket, theatre and music – and if
        you’re wondering about the strange combination, their social ambit is
        wide and they are a broad-minded nation. Bangladesh is among the few
        Asian nations where religions coexist in harmony. However, don’t be
        fooled by the smooth and urbane capital city, Dhaka – the smaller cities
        and villages are simple and well behind modern times.
